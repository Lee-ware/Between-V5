// ===================== PASS THE PHONE =====================
// Same-device, two-player mode. No accounts, no backend, no data leaves the
// device, nothing about either player is identified or stored individually —
// a match exists only in memory while it's being played. Deliberately kept
// to two simple game types rather than four, per the brief's own instruction
// not to overcomplicate this: "Debate" is mechanically identical to
// "Same Answer" (both answer blind, then compare), and "Chaos" would need
// its own content design rather than reusing existing questions — both are
// listed as backlog rather than built shallow.
